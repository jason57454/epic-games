# epic-games

I recreated the first page of epic games unreal engine website
This website is made with 5 sections. For fade animations, I used the AOS library.

The header part is made with HTML/CSS and keyframes for opacity animation.
The video effect is made with react, using lagrange interpolation.

This section is only made with HTML/CSS, with some fade animations.
