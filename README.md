# epic-games

I recreated the first page of epic games unreal engine website
This website is made with 5 sections. For fade animations, I used the AOS library.

The header part is made with HTML/CSS and keyframes for opacity animation.

This section is only made with HTML/CSS, with some fade animations.

Again, this is made with HTML/CSS and some fade animations. About the newsletter part, it's made with the "inset" css rule.
