# epic-games

I recreated the first page of epic games unreal engine website

It is not yet completed because I thought I had less than 24 hours to recreate it in order to show my front-end skills.

Nevertheless, I managed to recreate the first animation video with React.js and some html/css.

As I have a bit more time than I expected, I will update it very shortly to add the responsive designs (in 2 or 3 days).
